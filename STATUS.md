For zero-context continuation start with `AI_START_HERE.md` and `HANDOFF.md`. Immutable implementation evidence lives under `work-log/`.

## Current phase

**Milestone 7 — Floating Timer mode.**

- Milestone 1 / Gate A: **PASS**.
- Milestone 2 / Gate B: **PASS**.
- Milestone 3 / Gate C: **PASS**.
- Milestone 4 / Gate D: **PASS**.
- Milestone 5 / Gate E: **PASS**.
- Milestone 6 / Gate F: **PASS** — all 16 top-level items validated.
- Milestone 7: **ACTIVE / 8 of 14 top-level items validated**.
- Milestones 8–10: **NOT STARTED**.

General roadmap progress: **6 of 10 milestones complete**.

M7 items 1–6 and 13–14 are validated. The earlier CI #480/#501 physical expand/collapse failures are superseded by the physical CI #503 re-test: three complete native resize cycles, including expanded subtask controls, showed no retained/duplicated action strip in the collapsed DOM or pixels. Normal-size horizontal overflow and timer/session continuity passed. Item 7 remains open for continuous compositor smoothness and reduced-motion transition observation. Items 8–12 received the partial physical checks recorded in the latest work log; conflict/retry, display-topology/DPI, and independent fullscreen cases remain. Item 14's final-UI physical resource protocol completed on CI #505: three valid idle runs per state, each with zero churn, plus a separate running sample. Idle CPU medians were 0.000% of one core in both states; running average was 0.155%. Memory and caveats are in the work log. No M8 work has started.

## Current automated-validated source baseline

Latest automated-validated source is PR #143 head `9b80ee19c6678fca998b58740410f94c821cff26`, guarded merge `fce15f8ed7a70cd83e05f3b9448d627413b719e7`, identical tree `608aec06f64a3184568bc0d171adc1b085220fa9`. Windows CI #507 / run `36136277164` passed the full preflight (including executable Rust concurrency/retry/rollback tests), visual fixtures and Tauri release; duplicate main CI #508 was cancelled after tree identity. This source serializes Ctrl+Shift+T/P native registration with diagnostic-state updates and reconciles retry errors in the UI. It has not yet been physically shortcut-tested. The earlier #140/CI #505 executable supplied the physical idle-collapse and final-UI resource evidence; details and caveats remain in `work-log/2026-09-25-codex-m7-physical-runtime-and-idle-recovery.md`. Current exact artifact and continuation are in `HANDOFF.md`.

## Item 7 earlier physical candidate

PR #125 exact head `fb3547855433b87d576e1e78a5bbe58d5fc2570b`: Windows CI #486 / run `35939359726` / job `107443605380` PASS, including Repository Preflight, visual fixtures, Tauri Release, and diagnostic artifact.

Expected-head guarded squash merge `a7161acdf6a400147af0bbc44d52b1ec6ee64ea5` (tree `077435c468d4e5358b7a2e2b98417332d4e20a05`) passed resulting-main Windows CI #487 / run `35940723610` / job `107447795591` with the same required gates. Runtime artifact `10785466061`, `narro-m1-runtime-harness-windows-x64`, digest `sha256:f84bee3216cfe5d1762916cd54cd0d7703db283bdd7d1930b9b540a100764413`. Visual artifact `10785301496`, digest `sha256:c385e00fe2c06cb0084d17f002c9f82f77b0d9cfa67e95f491a7a0b12f7f941a`.

The target expanded/collapsed hierarchy stays visibility-hidden during native window hide/resize/show and a post-show presented-frame opportunity. Native failure attempts physical-size/visibility rollback, and renderer failure restores the previous expanded hierarchy. This is automated-validated source, not a physical compositor PASS.

## Prior compositor baseline before PR #125

Historical resulting-main automated-validated **source/test** baseline:

`6f99e9b1869b927e5a792cc569b6c8131859c7d8`

Tree:

`a8108fc403e94ab90dc9a85c2070b8852667109f`

This is the squash merge of PR #124 — `M7: mask stale focus content across native resize` — from exact validated PR head `2db045ef82286d8364d77a3ba9654842b9a66eb3`. The merge tree is byte-identical to the exact validated PR-head tree. Markdown-only tracking descendants do **not** replace this source/test baseline.

The PR #124 corrective source:

- preserves the existing finite exit transition, then marks the settled outgoing Focus root `visibility: hidden` before native Panel/Timer geometry runs;
- waits through a shared finite two-`requestAnimationFrame` presented-frame barrier before invoking native mode geometry;
- adds an explicit hidden Floating Timer `resizing` phase after the finite exit and before native collapsed/expanded geometry;
- publishes the final expanded/collapsed hierarchy while hidden, waits another finite presented-frame barrier, then performs the existing entrance transition;
- retains native/Rust geometry authority, the same reusable `focusSurface` webview, established 150ms/180ms motion tokens, reduced-motion behavior, and unchanged timer/session/task/scheduling semantics;
- adds deterministic contracts for the compositor barrier and updates the collapsed contract to the shared helper.

### PR #124 exact-head validation

Final PR head:

`2db045ef82286d8364d77a3ba9654842b9a66eb3`

Windows CI #479 / run `35929764331` / job `107413269935`: **SUCCESS**.

- Repository Preflight: **SUCCESS**;
- Windows visual regression: **SUCCESS**;
- Tauri Release: **SUCCESS**;
- visual artifact `10781122135`, digest `sha256:ddeeeb085aeea61a438d204d386c31dc0eb474567114914178d3ec0ebc5d5971`;

PR CI #478 failed only because the older collapsed deterministic contract still expected the previous inline single-rAF helper after the helper was centralized. The contract was corrected in forward test-only commit `2db045ef82286d8364d77a3ba9654842b9a66eb3`; final exact-head CI #479 passed. PR #124 had nine expected changed files and no comments, reviews or unresolved review threads.

### Resulting-main validation

Windows CI #480 / run `35931208957` / job `107417960065`: **SUCCESS** on exact main source SHA `6f99e9b1869b927e5a792cc569b6c8131859c7d8`.

Connector-side deterministic transition source-contract review: **PASS**. Local checkout/npm/Rust preflight in this environment: **NOT RUN**. The authoritative Windows repository preflight, visual regression and Tauri release gates passed on both the exact PR head and resulting main.

Automated validation does **not** prove transient desktop compositor behavior, so physical Windows re-validation remains the final item-7 gate.

## Milestone 6 validated work

Items 1–14 remain documented in their immutable M6 work logs and retain all previously validated invariants. Item 15 adds the following validated presentation behavior without changing authoritative task/timer/session/scheduling/native state:

### Item 15 — Focus visual states

Immutable evidence: `work-log/2026-09-17-2215-chatgpt-m6-focus-visual-states.md`.

Validated behavior:

- the active/running live card projects the existing authoritative timer state using the accent token family;
- paused and overtime states use warning treatment, break uses success treatment, and Time's Up uses destructive treatment;
- ordinary overdue rows project the existing authoritative `task.isOverdue` field and are visually distinct without renderer-side due-state recalculation;
- expanded Notes reuse the established `FocusLiveActions` -> `TaskNotes` path and receive only an expanded visual surface;
- no-eligible presentation is derived only when there is no live task, no Remaining task and at least one Scheduled future-timed task;
- item 15 intentionally preserves the existing empty-card copy and does not add item-16 empty/no-eligible behavior or controls;
- item-11 live-title motion, item-12 ordinary-row full-title access, item-13 reserved action geometry and item-14 tooltip/accessibility contracts remain intact;
- Windows light/dark fixtures cover running, paused, break, Time's Up, overtime, Notes-expanded and no-eligible states;
- asynchronous Notes capture uses a scenario-specific Edge virtual-time budget and the no-eligible dashed-state selector is specificity-safe against the base live-card border shorthand.

The implementation changed no Rust/Tauri, SQLite/schema, dependency/lockfile, task/domain, authoritative timer/session transition, scheduling classification, display-topology or persistence code.

### Item 16 — Empty/no-eligible Focus states

Immutable evidence: `work-log/2026-09-20-2229-chatgpt-m6-focus-empty-states.md`.

Validated behavior:

- generic idle remains distinct when Remaining work exists without a live task;
- no-eligible is shown only when there is no live/Remaining work and at least one future-timed Scheduled task;
- future-scheduled work stays visible in Scheduled and remains ineligible until due;
- genuinely empty Today uses the screenshot-backed `All Clear` state;
- empty/no-eligible states do not fabricate live timer/actions and do not own timer/session/scheduling authority;
- Windows light/dark fixtures and deterministic contracts cover both states;
- no Rust/Tauri, SQLite/schema, persistence, scheduling classification, task/domain or timer/session transition behavior changed.

## Milestone 7 validated work

### Item 1 — Same-window compact-mode foundation

Immutable evidence: `work-log/2026-09-21-1120-chatgpt-m7-floating-compact-mode.md`.

Validated behavior:

- the existing `focusSurface` webview transforms between product Panel and compact modes without creating another persistent webview;
- native Rust mode state remains presentation authority and is reconciled by the renderer on mount;
- product Compact control calls the native same-window transition and renderer mode publishes only after native success;
- compact -> Panel return uses the existing preference-aware `present_focus_panel` path;
- the minimal compact foundation preserves M1 always-on-top/skip-taskbar behavior without absorbing later collapsed/expanded content items;
- mode switching remains presentation-only and does not mutate timer/session/task/scheduling state;
- `?diagnostics=1` retains the M1 diagnostic surface.

CI history included two test-contract-only failures (#447 stale M6 root assertion; #449 LF/CRLF-brittle compact assertion). Both were corrected without production changes before exact-head CI #451 and resulting-main CI #452 passed all required gates.

### Item 2 — Floating Timer movability/topmost/taskbar

Implementation source: PR #118 / merge `f6c6b0fd58ab168f1f93d8a1ca19527bc4bfa044`.

Automated-validated behavior:

- the frameless product `FloatingTimerFoundation` exposes Tauri-native drag regions over non-interactive content;
- the return-to-Panel button is deliberately excluded from the drag region and remains interactive;
- `core:window:allow-start-dragging` is scoped to `focusSurface` only rather than broadened to `main`;
- native Timer mode remains authority for always-on-top and skip-taskbar state;
- no JS pointer/mouse move loop or renderer-owned `setPosition` path was added;
- safe-position persistence/recovery remains item 10 and borderless-full-screen topmost validation remains item 11;
- no timer/session/task/scheduling/persistence semantics changed.

Physical Windows validation:

- Drag Floating Timer: **PASS**;
- Return to Focus Panel button: **PASS**;
- always-on-top over normal apps: **PASS**;
- no normal Floating Timer taskbar button: **PASS**;
- final Panel position after return: correct original right-side position;
- observed transition artifact: a very brief left-side Panel flicker before settling right. This does not invalidate item 2 and is assigned to the later transition slice.

### Item 3 — Collapsed Floating Timer content

Immutable evidence: `work-log/2026-09-23-1421-codex-m7-floating-collapsed.md`.

Implementation source: PR #119 / merge `14db934e998b2bb619f04bf7e7a1b0fe7b5553fe`.

Validated behavior:

- native Timer mode uses the screenshot/spec-backed `340 x 110` collapsed viewport while retaining item-2 topmost/taskbar/drag authority;
- the title and subtask progress derive from the authoritative list-board projection;
- the timer derives from the existing revision-ordered authoritative timer/session projection;
- Focus Panel and Floating Timer share one timer presentation helper covering EST, count-up, Pomodoro, break, Time's Up and overtime states;
- Add and Expand affordances are visible but intentionally non-mutating until the ordered expanded-content slice;
- deterministic Windows light/dark fixtures validate the collapsed hierarchy and stable geometry;
- no renderer timer/session/task authority, polling, per-second persistence, continuous decorative animation or position loop was introduced.

PR Windows CI #458 and resulting-main Windows CI #459 passed Repository Preflight, Windows visual regression, Tauri Release and both required artifact uploads. Local frontend preflight also passed; local Rust/Tauri checks were unavailable because the local environment has no Rust toolchain.

### Items 4–6 — Expanded Floating Timer interactions

Immutable evidence: `work-log/2026-09-23-chatgpt-m7-floating-expanded-interactions.md`.

Implementation source: PR #120 / merge `97931f89ff2b6b9f1aa0ceb628732602be8fd587`.

Validated behavior:

- native Timer sizing supports the established `340 x 110` collapsed viewport and `340 x 300` expanded viewport without another focus webview;
- expand/collapse remains renderer presentation state and native resizing publishes before the renderer commits the corresponding presentation;
- expanded actions reuse the existing authoritative Focus paths for Break, Notes, Pause/Resume, Skip and Done, plus Return to Panel;
- expanded subtasks reuse persisted list-board subtask identities and mutations for create, completion/reopen, reorder and delete, including expected-value/order concurrency guards;
- saved subtask mutations refresh and reconcile authoritative subtask and board projections before more mutations continue;
- icon-only action/subtask controls retain stable 32 px geometry, accessible names and shared tooltips without changing Timer width;
- deterministic Windows light/dark visual fixtures cover collapsed and expanded density/geometry;
- no renderer timer/session/task/scheduling authority, high-frequency native geometry loop, polling clock or continuous decorative animation was introduced.

PR Windows CI #462 and resulting-main Windows CI #463 passed Repository Preflight, Windows visual regression, Tauri Release and both required artifact uploads.

## Milestone 7 — next ordered work

The prior #140 source and #138 DOM fix were physically exercised as detailed above. The new #143 shortcut registration/retry source has only automated validation; use its artifact for the consolidated remaining conditions in `docs/M7_FLOATING_RUNTIME_VALIDATION.md`, including basic shortcut recheck, conflict/retry, continuous transition/reduced-motion observation, unavailable monitor/taskbar/DPI recovery, and independent borderless/exclusive fullscreen. Avoid repeating completed resource runs without a performance-relevant source change. Do not advance to Milestone 8.

## Durable correctness decisions

Future work must preserve:

- Narro remains personal, local-only Windows 10/11 x64 software; no auth/cloud/telemetry/integration authority is introduced.
- Tauri 2 + React/TypeScript + authoritative Rust/domain state + SQLite remains the validated architecture.
- `main` and reusable `focusSurface` remain the normal two-webview model.
- native/Rust window coordination remains monitor/work-area/DPI/physical-position authority.
- display-topology handling remains event-driven and coalesced; no renderer/high-frequency polling loop is introduced.
- authoritative task/list/subtask/session/timer/scheduling/note/archive/preferences state remains outside renderer memory; persistence-first mutations remain the success boundary.
- stable identities, tracked Time Taken, scheduling/date-only/timezone/recurrence semantics and All Lists aggregate semantics must not regress.
- future-timed Today tasks remain ineligible until due.
- repeated Focus entry cannot duplicate or silently switch an existing live session.
- Focus queue partitioning cannot clone identities or reinterpret scheduling state.
- Break/Pause-Resume/Skip/Done remain authoritative timer/session transitions.
- Notes URLs require explicit pointer/keyboard activation and may never auto-launch from Focus entry/task switching/Notes opening.
- item-11 active/live title scrolling remains preference-driven, overflow-aware, transform-only and reduced-motion-safe.
- ordinary Focus row titles remain two-line-clamped with accessible full-title access.
- Focus action controls keep item-13 reserved geometry and existing hit positions.
- item-14 icon-only tooltips preserve accessible names, placeholder inactivity and stable geometry.
- item-15 visual states remain presentation-only projections of authoritative state; item 16 must not turn those markers into domain authority.
- hover/focus interactions may not reflow sibling geometry; reduced-motion remains usable and timer numerals remain tabular.
- excluded account/trial/upgrade/profile/AI/integration controls remain absent; diagnostics remain gated behind `?diagnostics=1`.
